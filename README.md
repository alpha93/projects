In this repository I keep the small things I make for my own learning purposes. Below is a list of things I made with some details (the executables can be found in the respective target directories, all of which require a minimum of jre-8) -

Asteroids - An Asteroids game I made as my first JavaFx project. Movements are controlled by the arrow keys and the z-key fires bullets.

PhysicsDemo - My first attempt at using the JBox2D physics engine with JavaFx, where if the mouse is clicked anywhere on the window and dragged, objects are spawned and they inreract with each other obeying Newtonian physics.
